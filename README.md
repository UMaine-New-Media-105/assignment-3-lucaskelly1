Challenge 1:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/vFl8HDlvR

This code draws a vacuum sprite that moves left to right depending on the mouses location. It must be in a 50x50 location. 
The code uses width and height to keep it on the canvas. 
It also uses translate to move it away from the top corner. 
Also, the trapazoid is made using vertexes. 

Challenge 2:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/XoKj7GIC2

This uses the same code as challenge 1, but also includes a mouseIspressed command to make the vacuum change appearence, blue to red. 

Challenge 3:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/K0m1Hq-JN

This uses the same code, but alo includes a piece of dirt that rises on the canvas. The vacuums job will be to collect the dirt.
There is a small error with the code here because the dirt accelerates upwards. 
To make the dirt, there is another sprite included in the code, as well as an if statement to reset it. 

Challenge 4:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/o6Qakrvgo

Now, it uses the same code, but instead it will make the dirt rise on command depending on if the mouse was clicked or not. Plus, it will reset when the vacuum is on top of the dirt. 

Challenge 5:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/UEJAi8Sai

This code is the same, but instead, part of the appearence disappears when the vacuum is on top of the dirt.
